	<h2 id="introHeader">My Music History</h2>
	<p id="introduction">My life has been filled with the beauty of music. Since I was three years old until today,
	I have played in concerts, high school band and orchestra, and local clubs around the Tacoma area. Music is everywhere
	in the world, and penetrates our very souls. That is why I have dedicated so much of my life to playing it. My
	hope is that you will find the beauty for yourself as you look over this site.</p>
